Welcome {{brand_name}},

We’re so excited that you are here!
Tailorie is on a mission to help brands and consumers discover one another — providing meaningful introductions is our specialty. You’ll find authentic storytelling is at the heart of the Tailorie platform and we are thrilled to tell yours.


Upload Your Brand Intro Video
Now that you’ve completed the onboarding process, the next step is to upload your brand intro video. This step is required to activate your Tailorie profile.

Videos are incredibly popular and effective.
Consumers truly want to know you, so we encourage you to make videos that represent your brand authentically. No need to hire a professional! A phone and your story is all you need to get started.


What’s Next?
The Tailorie app is set to launch soon! This gives you time to create your video(s). If needed, you can also modify the brand profile you created during onboarding.


Our team is here to help!
We know new things can drum up a few questions so email us at join@tailorie.com if anything comes up!


Happy Tailoring!
– The Tailorie Team
